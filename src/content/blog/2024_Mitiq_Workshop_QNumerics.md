We are pleased to announce the first in-person Mitiq workshop, which will be held as part of the [Numerical Methods in Quantum Information Science (QIS) Summer School](https://qnumerics.org/) at the Mount Ida campus of University of Massachusetts Amherst. The School spans through August 12-18, 2024, with Saturday, August 17, 2024 fully dedicated to Mitiq and quantum error mitigation.
The summer school program is designed for community members "with QIS expertise and baseline programming skills searching to significantly expand them," including graduate students, postdocs and professionals, as well as exceptional undergraduates and "hackers" - builders who are passionate about open quantum technology.

The program's focus on practical, experiential learning with an emphasis on programming skills and hackathon-style sessions each evening made it a natural fit for hosting the Mitiq workshop.
Other topics covered in the summer school include general software engineering practices and cluster computing tools, advanced general scientific programming, GPU programming, fast general purpose wavefunction simulation, tensor networks for faster approximate quantum simulations, stabilizer formalism for quantum error correction, discrete event simulations, quantum chemistry, symbolic computer algebra basics, optimal control of quantum hardware, APIs for control of commercial quantum hardware.

We look forward to presenting topics including quantum error mitigation (QEM) core concepts and techniques, Mitiq structure and interface, and deep dive into the techniques of Zero Noise Extrapolation and Digital Dynamical Decoupling.
In the later part of the session, we will explore QEM on simulated noisy backends with benchmarks and calibration.
The workshop will conclude in the evening with a Mitiq hackathon.
To learn more about [Mitiq](https://unitary.fund/research/mitiq/), an open source quantum error mitigation compiler with over 100k downloads and developed by the Unitary Fund technical team with a community of over 70 contributors worldwide, see the [Mitiq documentation](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
